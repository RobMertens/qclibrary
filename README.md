# QuadCopter-Library
This code represents a object-orientated quadcopter library for an Arduino based quadcopter.
My hardware components are:

(1) 1x Arduino MEGA ADK (same pinout as MEGA)

(2) 1x Reely HT-5 TX/RX

(3)	1x MPU6050 w/ level shifter

(4) 4x Turnigy Plush 10A

(5) 4x DYS BE1806-2300kV

Future extensions include compatibility with other Arduino's.

If you are using another arduino make sure it works with 16MHz clock speed.
For addressing the  correct registers see your arduino type PINOUT-diagram.
